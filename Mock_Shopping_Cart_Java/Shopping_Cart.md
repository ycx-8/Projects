**Project Idea**: Simple Shopping Cart

**Description**: Create a console-based program that simulates a simple shopping cart in a grocery store. You can use an array to represent the shopping cart. Each slot in the array can contain the name of an item (like "Apple", "Bread", etc.).

**Here are the features your program should have:**

Add item: The user can input the name of an item to add it to the shopping cart. If the cart is already full, inform the user that they cannot add more items.

Remove item: The user can input the name of an item to remove it from the shopping cart. If the item is not in the cart, inform the user.

View cart: Display the contents of the shopping cart to the user. Show each item on a new line.

Checkout: Display the total number of items in the shopping cart.

**Hints:**

You will need to use a loop to interact with the user repeatedly until they choose to exit the program.
You will also need to use conditionals to handle the different options the user can select (add item, remove item, view cart, checkout).
Use an array to store the items in the shopping cart. You might find it helpful to use a "counter" variable to keep track of how many items are in the cart.
